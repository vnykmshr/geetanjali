"""Worker-specific metrics imports for the RQ worker service.

This module imports ONLY event-based metrics that worker should expose.
It does NOT import from utils.metrics (which would register business gauges).

## Metrics Architecture

Each Python process has its OWN Prometheus registry. When both are scraped:

1. **Counters/Histograms**: Prometheus aggregates from both sources.
   Use `sum()` in queries to get total.

2. **Circuit Breaker State Gauges**: Both expose these. Use `max()` to see worst state.

3. **Business/Infra Gauges**: Only backend exposes. Worker does NOT import these.

## What This Module Registers

Importing this module registers these metrics in the worker's registry:
- LLM counters (llm_requests_total, llm_tokens_total, llm_fallback_total)
- LLM circuit breaker state
- Email counters and histogram
- Email circuit breaker state
- Cache hit/miss counters
- Vector search fallback counter
- ChromaDB circuit breaker state
- Circuit breaker transition counter
