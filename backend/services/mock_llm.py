**The core principle** is this: focus on doing what's right, not on what you'll get from it. The Geeta calls this **nishkama karma** - action without attachment to outcomes.

In practical terms:
- **Step 1**: Identify what you *should* do (your duty)
- **Step 2**: Do it with full effort and care
- **Step 3**: Release your grip on the results

This doesn't mean you don't care about outcomes - it means you don't let fear of failure or desire for success paralyze your action. As BG_2_47 reminds us: "You have the right to action, but not to the fruits of action."

**Consider Option 1** (Nishkama Karma) if:
- You have clear responsibilities you've been avoiding
- You're paralyzed by worrying about outcomes
- You need to act but fear is holding you back

**Consider Option 2** (Jnana Yoga) if:
- The situation is genuinely unclear
- You're acting from impulse rather than wisdom
- You need deeper understanding before deciding

**Consider Option 3** (Equanimity) if:
- External circumstances are beyond your control
- You're emotionally reactive to the situation
- You need inner stability before taking action

The Bhagavad Geeta presents a nuanced view of ethical action. At its heart is the recognition that **we suffer not from action itself, but from our attachment to outcomes**.

**Key insight from BG_2_48**: "Perform your duty with evenness of mind, abandoning attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga."

This means:
1. **Engage fully** - Don't use detachment as an excuse for half-hearted effort
2. **Stay present** - Focus on the quality of your action, not future rewards
3. **Accept results gracefully** - Whether success or failure, learn and move forward

The practical application here is to ask yourself: "Am I doing this because it's right, or because I want a specific outcome?" If it's the latter, you may need to realign your motivation.

**From BG_2_47**: You control your actions, but not their fruits. Do your best and release anxiety about outcomes.

**From BG_6_7**: The self-controlled person remains calm in both success and failure, heat and cold, honor and dishonor.

The path forward often becomes clearer when we step back from our immediate desires and ask: "What is my duty here? What would serve the highest good?"
