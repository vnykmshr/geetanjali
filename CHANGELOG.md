# Changelog

All notable changes to Geetanjali are documented here.

## [1.11.0] - 2025-12-16

Search, Reading Mode, and Design System release.

### Features
- **Search** - Multi-strategy hybrid search across 701 verses. Canonical lookup (2.47), Sanskrit text (कर्म, karmaṇy), keyword search with OR logic, principle filtering, and semantic fallback. Match transparency shows why each result was found.
- **Reading Mode** - Immersive scripture reading at `/read`. Swipe navigation, tap-to-reveal translations, chapter intros, progress tracking, font size controls, keyboard shortcuts (J/K/←/→).
- **Design System** - Mobile-first responsive patterns. Warm amber surfaces, orange-600 primary, Spectral headings, Source Sans body. Consistent spacing and component patterns.

### Improvements
- **Navigation** - Search in navbar and hamburger menu. Context-aware back navigation from verse detail. ⌘K keyboard shortcut.
- **Search UX** - Recent searches dropdown, topic pills for browsing, featured verse spotlight, consultation suggestion for situational queries, infinite scroll with load more.
- **Content Filtering** - Search-specific moderation (stricter than consultation). Frontend mirrors backend rules for instant feedback.
- **Docs Site** - Aligned typography and colors with main app. Spectral + Source Sans fonts, warm amber palette.

### Documentation
- Rewrote search.md with architecture diagrams and hybrid OR search explanation
- Added design.md covering frontend design language and patterns
- Rewrote backend and frontend READMEs based on code analysis
- Reorganized docs index for public presentation

### Technical
- Hybrid OR search ranks by keyword match count (more matches = higher rank)
- Five search strategies: canonical, Sanskrit, keyword, principle, semantic
- PostgreSQL JSONB for principle filtering, ChromaDB for semantic search
- Skip PostgreSQL-only tests on SQLite in CI

## [1.10.0] - 2025-12-11

Quality and security improvements from comprehensive code review.

### Security
- **CSP Hardening** - Removed `unsafe-inline` from Content-Security-Policy, changed default-src to `'none'`, added `frame-ancestors 'none'`
- **Rate Limiting** - Added rate limits to message endpoints (GET: 60/min, POST: 10/min)

### Reliability
- **Stale Processing Timeout** - Cases stuck in PROCESSING for >5 minutes are automatically failed when polled, preventing indefinite hangs
- **Silent Handler Logging** - Added logging to previously silent exception handlers in follow-up background processing

### Improvements
- **Content Filter Alignment** - Aligned frontend gibberish detection thresholds with backend for consistent validation
- **Prompt Truncation Logging** - Added logging when follow-up prompts are truncated (>500 chars)
- **Cache Invalidation** - Public case caches (outputs, messages) are now invalidated when new content is created
- **Contact Form Validation** - Refactored to use centralized `validate_submission_content` for consistent content filtering

### Technical
- Consolidated frontend content filter constants with backend values
- Added `STALE_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT` config setting (300s default)
- Improved CSP headers with explicit directives for API responses

## [1.9.0] - 2025-12-10

Follow-up conversations and quality improvements.

### Features
- **Follow-up Conversations** - Lightweight conversational follow-ups after initial consultation without full RAG regeneration. Async processing via RQ worker with rate limiting (30/hour).
- **Refine Guidance CTA** - Low-confidence outputs now show a "Refine Guidance" call-to-action prompting users to provide more context.
- **Few-Shot Example Toggle** - Configurable few-shot examples in RAG pipeline for improved output consistency.

### Improvements
- Accessibility: Added `lang="sa"` attribute for Sanskrit text, ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Follow-up input changed from single-line to textarea with Enter key submission

### Technical
- Async follow-up processing: HTTP 202 Accepted, background worker processes LLM, frontend polls for completion
- Rate limiting on follow-up endpoint (30/hour, 3x analyze rate)
- Dedicated error context for follow-up errors with user-friendly messages
- Empty LLM response validation before persisting messages
- Pruned low-value frontend tests to reduce CI time

### Fixes
- Fixed error message context using correct `followUp` handler instead of `caseAnalyze`
