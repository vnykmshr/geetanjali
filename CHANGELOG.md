# Changelog

All notable changes to Geetanjali are documented here.

## [1.15.0] - 2025-12-24

Circuit breaker resilience, comprehensive observability, and operational metrics.

### Features
- **Circuit Breakers** - Per-service circuit breakers (LLM, ChromaDB, Email) with configurable thresholds and recovery timeouts. Prevents cascade failures during outages.
- **LLM Fallback Tracking** - Metrics track fallback events with reason labels (circuit_open, retries_exhausted, error) for better debugging.
- **Vector Search Fallback** - SQL keyword search fallback when ChromaDB is unavailable, tracked via metrics.
- **Cache Metrics** - Hit/miss counters by key type (verse, search, metadata, case, rag) for cache efficiency monitoring.

### Infrastructure
- **Grafana Dashboard** - New sections: Resilience (circuit breaker states), Cache & Data Retrieval (hit rate, fallback tracking), Email Service (success rate, send duration), Worker Queue (depth, failed jobs).
- **Prometheus Alerts** - Circuit breaker state alerts with configurable thresholds for proactive incident response.
- **API Error Tracking** - `api_errors_total` counter wired to all exception handlers with normalized endpoint paths.
- **Case Views Accuracy** - Daily views now tracked via Redis counter for accurate 24h metrics.

### Technical
- Abstract `CircuitBreaker` base class with state transitions and metrics integration
- Per-provider LLM circuit breakers (Anthropic, Ollama) with independent failure tracking
- Cache TTL jitter prevents stampede during high-traffic periods
- Retry-before-circuit pattern: retries exhaust before recording circuit failure
- 24+ new tests for cache operations and circuit breaker behavior

### Improvements
- Email retry decorator with metrics integration for all email types
- Failed jobs metric for RQ worker queue monitoring
- Endpoint path normalization prevents Prometheus cardinality explosion
- Config constant for daily counter TTL (timezone-safe 48h window)

## [1.14.0] - 2025-12-23

Deployment resilience, improved email verification UX, and test coverage.

### Features
- **Chunk Loading Recovery** - Automatic retry and page reload when users encounter stale chunks after deployment. Prevents "failed to load" errors during navigation.

## [1.11.3] - 2025-12-17

Bug fixes and resilience improvements for RAG pipeline and content validation.

### Features
- **RAG Verse Injection** - When LLM returns fewer than 3 source citations (or uses wrong format), system now injects relevant RAG-retrieved verses as fallback. Applies confidence penalty (-0.03 per injected verse) rather than hard failure.

### Fixes
- **JSON Parsing** - Fixed `extract_json_from_text()` returning string instead of dict, causing "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" errors.
- **Legacy Data Handling** - Schema now handles legacy outputs with string sources (`['BG_2_47']`) and empty options arrays gracefully via model validator.
- **Gibberish Detection** - Expanded common words list and relaxed thresholds (20%→12% ratio, 2→1 distinct words). Valid queries like "Do personal obligations ever justify bending professional standards?" no longer rejected.
- **Source Validation** - Fixed bug where invalid option sources (e.g., "Verse 1" instead of "BG_2_47") weren't filtered when root sources array was empty.
- **Follow-up Validation UX** - Validation errors now display inline near the input field, not just at page top.

### Technical
- Added `forgot-password` and `reset-password` to CSRF-exempt paths (pre-auth flows)
- Disabled Redis caching in tests (`REDIS_ENABLED=false`) for isolation
- Skip vector store tests by default (`SKIP_VECTOR_TESTS=true`)

## [1.11.2] - 2025-12-17

UX improvements for verse discovery and consultation quality.

### Features
- **Verse Reference Auto-Linking** - Verse references in guidance text (BG 2.47, BG_3_35) are now clickable. Click to see a popover with the leadership insight and option to view full verse. Supports multiple formats.
- **Raw LLM Storage for Policy Violations** - Backend now stores raw LLM response when content is flagged, enabling debugging and refinement of refusal detection.

### Improvements
- **Concise Guidance** - Updated prompts for crisper responses: initial guidance now 100-150 words (was 150-250), follow-ups 50-100 words (was 2-4 paragraphs).
- **Verse Citation Constraints** - Prompts now explicitly instruct LLM to only cite verses provided in context, preventing hallucinated verse references.
- **Refusal Detection** - Three-strategy fix reduces false positives: JSON-first check, position-based matching (first 500 chars), and quote-aware pattern detection. Valid guidance containing phrases like "I can't help" in suggested dialogue is no longer incorrectly flagged.
- **Unified Thinking Indicators** - Consolidated thinking/loading indicators into reusable ThinkingIndicator component.
- **Navigation** - Verse links from case view now properly return to case context.

### Fixes
- Aligned follow-up response format with main guidance style (paragraph structure, headers)
- Prevented duplicate thinking indicators during follow-up processing

## [1.11.1] - 2025-12-16

Polish release focusing on typography, readability, and case view improvements.

### Features
- **Executive Summary Formatting** - Post-processing for LLM responses adds paragraph breaks around section headers (**Wisdom from the Geeta**, **Closing**), improving readability without relying on LLM formatting consistency.

### Improvements
- **Typography** - Custom prose styling with amber-800 bold text and Spectral serif italics. Increased font sizes in Guidance Summary sections for better readability.
- **Case View** - Unified status handling shows user question consistently across draft, pending, processing, and failed states. Draft cases now display "Get Guidance" button.
- **Reading Mode** - Improved contrast with gray text, larger font size step increments for noticeable difference.
- **Search** - Auto-focus on search input, cleaner spotlight card without redundant labels.
- **New Case** - Inspiration verse displayed inline with reference link.
- **Home** - Reduced hero tagline font size on mobile for better balance.
- **Waiting State** - Fixed quote layout shift, reduced shimmer prominence.
- **Prompts** - Enriched executive_summary with structured "Wisdom from the Geeta" section.

### Technical
- Centralized curated verses in single location (`curatedVerses.ts`)
- Markdown rendering added to PublicCaseView (was showing raw `**` markers)
- Post-processing is idempotent - safe if LLM returns well-formatted text

## [1.11.0] - 2025-12-16
